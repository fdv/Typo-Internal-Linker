====================

This plugin allow you to build your SEO internal linking displaying links from your articles tagging. Instead of having your tag links pointing to useless tag pages, they will point to articles using these words the most.

=======

After downloading this plugin, you'll have to run 2 rake tasks :

rake typo_internal_linker_create_table # will create the needed table
rake typo_internal_linker_populate_table # will populate the table with your existing content

Remember to run the second one every time you publsh a new article as you'll need to update the table.


Then in your theme, where you display a single article tag links, replace the line containing tag_links(article) with:

show_seo_tags(article)
